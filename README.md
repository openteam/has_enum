# has_enum

Gem for Rails 3 app to easily handle enumeration attributes in models.

## Installation and configuration

This gem has been designed for Rails 3 only.

### Install gem

Insert
    gem 'has_enum'
in your Rails 3 Gemfile. Then do
    $ bundle install

## Usage
### Models
Here's example model:

```ruby
class TestModel < ActiveRecord::Base
   has_enum :category, %w( stuff things misc )
   has_enum :color   , %w( red green blue )       , :scopes        => true
   has_enum :size    , %w( small medium large )   , :query_methods => false
   has_enum :status  , [:pending, :failed, :done]
end
```

Query methods are available by default. For example, query methods for color enum this methods will be available:

      color_green?
      color_red?
      color_blue?

If you set *:scopes => true* these scopes will be available:

```ruby
   color_green
   color_red
   color_blue
```

See [sample usage in specs](https://github.com/openteam/has_enum/blob/master/spec/has_enum_spec.rb).

### Views

```ruby
    radio_button_enum(object_name, method, options = {})
    select_enum(object_name, method, options = {})
```

#### Usage with Formtastic (Monkeypatch)

If you are using another gems that inherited from formtastic the most simple method will be to add this code
in your *config/initializers/formtastic.rb*:

```ruby
    class Formtastic::SemanticFormBuilder
      def enum_input(method, options = {})
        value = @object.send(method)
        additional_params = {:as => :select, :collection => @object.class.values_for_select_tag(method)}
        self.input(method, options.merge(additional_params)).gsub(/class="select/, 'class="enum')
      end
    end
```

Or if you sure you don't use any the proper method is to inherit from it:

```ruby
    class CustomBuilder < Formtastic::SemanticFormBuilder
      def enum_input(method, options = {})
        value = @object.send(method)
        additional_params = {:as => :select, :collection => @object.class.values_for_select_tag(method)}
        self.input(method, options.merge(additional_params)).gsub(/class="select/, 'class="enum')
      end
    end
```

And uncomment
```ruby
    Formtastic::SemanticFormHelper.builder = CustomBuilder
```

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
